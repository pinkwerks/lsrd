# lsrd - little surface reconstruction demo

This project was used to build a surface-reconstruction visualization. Aka spatial-mapping for HoloLens.

Note: Most screen-captures from HoloLens look terrible, as black colors are see-through on that display. The shaders take advantage of this and avoid transparency blending for performance reasons.
